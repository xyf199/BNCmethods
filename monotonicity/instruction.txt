1. To check monotonicity for parameters, please first install the SMT-Solver dreal, it is availiable under http://dreal.github.io.

2. The main method is in monotonicity.cpp.

3. Enter the file name. (for example, hepar2_100_hepatotoxic)

4. Enter the query (for example, a = yes, b = no, c = yes, d = no). We use yes/no (words) instead of 0/1 (numbers).

Note1: In the experiments, we use the non-standard version of bif files for parameter, that is, e.g. parameter p0 is written as p00
if we have up to double-digit parameters, p0 is written as p000 if we have up to three-figure parameters. We use the method
replaceparameter() or replaceparameter2() to get the derived files. Replaceparameter() is used if we have up to double-digit
parameters, replaceparameter2() is used if we have three-figure parameters.

Note2: We use checkmonotonicitysimplify4() to check monotonicity, if one parameter appears only in one CPT's row. If one 
parameter can appear at rows in different CPTs (or appear at more than one row in a CPT), we use the method
checkmonotonicitysimplify6().

Note3: If we want to check monotonicity for parameters in a conditional query, we use the method:
checkmonotonicitysimplifyundercondition().
