1. The main method is in "transform_bn_to_bnc".

2. Enter the file name (without the extension .bif)

3. Enter the name of the root you choose

4. The bnc file is in the folder "bnc" with the name "filename_rootname.bif"

Note: Please double-check the tranlated BNC files. CPT entities may be missing due to something unexpected, for example the name of a node is a subset of the name of another node. In our translated BNCs, we have and only have missing CPT entities for the BN andes.bif until now.
